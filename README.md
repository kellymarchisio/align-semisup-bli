===

The code in this directory implements:
- Kelly Marchisio, Conghao Xiong, and Philipp Koehn. 2021. **An Alignment-Based Approach to Semi-Supervised Bilingual Lexicon Induction with Small Parallel Corpora**. Machine Translation Summit, 2021. 

Quickstart
---------
To download required data and scripts, run: `sh setup.sh`
Running `sh run-all.sh` will run all main experiments from Table 3 of the published work.
---------
Note: This version of the code does not require a GPU. Parts of the embedding
mapping and evaluation can be sped up with a GPU by using the --cuda flag.
